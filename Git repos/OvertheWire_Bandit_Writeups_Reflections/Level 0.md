
[Level 0](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html) is the easiest  level of [OvertheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)'s Capture the Flag (CTF) Bandit and possibly the easiest level of all of their capture the flag games. The instructions are in the links and just reading them will tell you what to do. 

The objective of this level is to log into level 0 of the game and OvertheWire gives you all the tools to do so. They give you two links, one to the Secure Shell Wikipedia page and another to a WikiHow article on Secure Shell. The WikiHow article is an instructional guide and if you follow the steps, you'll log into the level. 

I did make some beginner mistakes while attempting to login to the level, mainly forgetting the ssh in front of the command and leaving off the port specification, but the terminal and commands were familiar enough that things started coming back. It hasn't been that long since I last used a terminal. The last time was back in 2023 for work as we were making sure our software was connected to the server before starting testing. 

I really liked that level 0 was figuring out how to log into the game because that's a cool concept and reminds me of all those hidden bars/speakeasys you hear about online. I do wish the level had been a little harder, but it's for complete beginners so the handholding is nice.
