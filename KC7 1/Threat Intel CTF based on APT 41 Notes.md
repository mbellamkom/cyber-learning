Message received from partner licensing HeatShield about suspicious activity coming from IP 185.210.94.2.

Information about IP's should be in the Inbound Network Events table. Using 

```
InboundNetworkEvents
|take 10
```
we can see what fields the table contains. 

![](<./assets/Threat Intel CTF based on APT 41 Notes/Pasted image 20250719124153.png>)
src_ip is the one we need. 

Using the query

```
InboundNetworkEvents
| where src_ip == "185.210.94.2"
```
we find that there are 24 records of the IP.

Now, we're looking for how many successful login attempts there were from 185.210.94.2.

```
AuthenticationEvents
|take 10 
```

![](<./assets/Threat Intel CTF based on APT 41 Notes/Pasted image 20250719125653.png>)
and running 

```
AuthenticationEvents
|where result == "Successful"
|where src_ip == "185.210.94.2"
```
doesn't give us anything
![](<./assets/Threat Intel CTF based on APT 41 Notes/Pasted image 20250719125808.png>)

We're mapping this IP to a domain by using the PassiveDNS table

Running the following query, shows us that the IP maps to telemetryfinancegaming.net

```
PassiveDns
| where ip == "185.210.94.2"
```

Looking up the domain in the PassiveDNS table shows us 3 distinct IPs that all resolve to the same domain.
Running a query on those IP's
```
PassiveDns
| where ip == "185.210.94.4" or ip == "185.210.94.4" or ip == "185.210.94.3"
```
gives us 4 distinct domains 
![](<./assets/Threat Intel CTF based on APT 41 Notes/Pasted image 20250719131408.png>)

Intel gives us 3 well known groups to look out for. 

### üßë‚Äçüíª Brass Typhoon

- Targets gaming, finance, and technology
- Known for dual-purpose ops: espionage and financially motivated attacks
- Common TTPs include spearphishing, credential dumping, and use of living-off-the-land binaries
- Frequently uses spoofed business-related infrastructure

### üêº Velvet Panda

- Typically targets NGOs, government, and think tanks
- Known for spearphishing with lures tied to current events
- Uses PlugX and similar remote access tools
- Sometimes uses infrastructure with .cn domains and generic names

### üêâ Granite Typhoon

- Historical focus on espionage and intellectual property theft
- Associated with watering hole attacks and backdoored websites
- Uses web shells, DLL sideloading, and spoofed corporate domains
- Targeted a wide range of industries, including tech and defense

Knowing what techniques these threat actors use means that we have a place to start. We can check the Email log to see if any emails contained links to these suspicious domains. 

Query used:
```
Email
| where links contains "telemetry-finance-gaming.net"
or links contains "gaming-telemetry-finance.cn"
or links contains "telemetryfinancegaming.net"
or links contains "gaming-telemetry-finance.com"
or links contains "gamingtelemetryfinance.cn"
```
![](<./assets/Threat Intel CTF based on APT 41 Notes/Pasted image 20250719133828.png>)
It looks like 4 employees received these links. 

These 4 employees also received suspicious files attached to the email. Running a query for these files

```
Email
| where attachments contains "GreasyTender_Audit_Report.pdf" or attachments contains "GT_TelemetrySync.log.pdf"
```
shows us that 10 employees in total received these files. 

Out of all the 10  employees that received these files, there were only 3 distinct roles targeted: Monetization & Economy Designer, Fraud Prevention Specialist, and Game Currency Analyst

![](<./assets/Threat Intel CTF based on APT 41 Notes/Pasted image 20250719135538.png>)

The 10 employees that had the attachments on their machine are the same employees that received the file. 

Part 3 Question 2 - persistence technique: scheduled tasks
```
ProcessEvents
|where process_commandline contains "schtasks"
|where timestamp between(datetime(2024-03-09 09:12:47)..datetime(2024-03-21))
```
